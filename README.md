Standard Template Library (STL) in c++ provides heap functionality. But it does not provide some necessary heap operations like heap increase key, heap decrease key, etc. To overcome this issue, a Min Heap header file in C++ (Cpp) has been made. This header file provides many necessary operations like heapify, insert, get size, get capacity, extract min, heap increase key, heap decrease key, heap sort, and show element at a given index. Moreover, its input is not restricted to integer (int) arrays. Along with built in data types, it can also perform these operations on user defined classes to which necessary overloading code has been added. Also a sample program named sample program.cpp has been created to demonstrate the usage of min heap header file in c++ (cpp) i.e. minHeap.h
